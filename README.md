This script was intended to help me break down my expenses in ways that Mint does not currently provide. I personally want to know how much I am spending in each group of categories per month. This allows me to generate a spreadsheet that breaks down my expenses in the way that I currenty use and categorize Mint transactions.

To use this:
1. Download your Mint transaction history to the same folder and name it 'transactions.csv'
1. Update the date range in `ruby monthlyBreakdown.rb`
1. Run `ruby monthlyBreakdown.rb`

Note: this is intended for my personal use and as a proof of concept that it will be useful. The plan moving forward is to develop an interactive web application that will allow you to import files, modify categories, and establish your own date ranges.

Any feedback you provide will be considered for the aforementioned application.
